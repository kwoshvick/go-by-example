You can have an if statement without an else.

A statement can precede conditionals; any variables declared in this statement are available in the current and all 
subsequent branches.

Note that you don’t need parentheses around conditions in Go, but that the braces are required.

There is no ternary if in Go, so you’ll need to use a full if statement even for basic conditions.
