Interfaces are named collections of method signatures.

Here’s a basic interface for geometric shapes.

For our example we’ll implement this interface on rect and circle types.

To implement an interface in Go, we just need to implement all the methods in the interface. Here we implement geometry on rects.

The implementation for circles.
