Variadic functions can be called with any number of trailing arguments. For example, fmt.Println is a common variadic function.

Hereâ€™s a function that will take an arbitrary number of ints as arguments.

Within the function, the type of nums is equivalent to []int. We can call len(nums), iterate over it with range, etc.

Variadic functions can be called in the usual way with individual arguments.

If you already have multiple args in a slice, apply them to a variadic function using func(slice...) like this.
