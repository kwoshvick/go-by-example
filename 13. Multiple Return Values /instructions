Go has built-in support for multiple return values. This feature is used often in idiomatic Go, for example to return both result and error values from a function.

The (int, int) in this function signature shows that the function returns 2 ints.

Here we use the 2 different return values from the call with multiple assignment.

If you only want a subset of the returned values, use the blank identifier _.
